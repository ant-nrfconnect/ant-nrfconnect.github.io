.. option:: CONFIG_ANT_SDC_INIT

*Allow ANT Init to initialize the Softdevice Controller (sdc_init)*

Type: ``bool``

Help
====

Allow ANT initialization on the network core to also initialize the softdevice
controller. This is to allow the ANT library stack to utlize the sdc_soc
interface for cryptographic purposes. If sdc_init() is run prior to ANT
initialization (eg. for BT), then this configuration is not needed as long as
it is run before using any ANT library stack cryptographic functions.

Direct dependencies
